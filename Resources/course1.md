# Course Section 1 

## Testing Functional Code
**In File:** `exercises/exercise1/tests/ValidateDevelopmentEnvironment.cpp`
* [ ] Validate environment
    * [ ] Run the test
    * [ ] Fix the test
**In File:** `exercises/exercise1/tests/TrigMathTests.cpp`
* [ ] Run first test
    * [ ] Uncomment the REQUIRE line
    * Confirmation: See failure message
* [ ] Get the test to pass
    * Confirmation: See green result
* [ ] Test Asin() completely
    * [ ] Write a new test for Asin()
    * [ ] Check coverage of Asin() with break points
        * [ ] Add a breakpoint on every line of Asin()
        * [ ] Remove breakpoint when hit
        * Confirmation: No more breakpoints in Asin()
    * [ ] Install OpenCppCoverage in Visual Studio
        * Confirmation: Visual Studio's Tools menu has "Run OpenCppCoverage"
    * [ ] Run test coverage
        * Confirmation: See what areas of TrigMath.cpp are green (covered)
    * Confirmation: See 100% coverage of the Asin() method
* [ ] Test TrigMath completely
    * Confirmation: See 100% coverage of the code
    * Code Coverage reached: ______%
* [ ] Explanations and Retrospective
