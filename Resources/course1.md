# Course Section 1 

## Testing Functional Code
**In File:** `exercises/exercise1/tests/ValidateDevelopmentEnvironment.cpp`
* [ ] Validate environment
    * [ ] Run the test
    * [ ] Fix the test
**In File:** `exercises/exercise1/tests/TrigMathTests.cpp`
* [ ] Run first test
    * [ ] Uncomment the REQUIRE line
    * Confirmation: See failure message
* [ ] Get the test to pass
    * Confirmation: See green result
* [ ] Test Asin() completely
    * [ ] Write a new test for Asin()
    * [ ] Check coverage of Asin() with break points
        * [ ] Add a breakpoint on every line of Asin()
        * [ ] Remove breakpoint when hit
        * Confirmation: No more breakpoints in Asin()
    * [ ] Install OpenCppCoverage in Visual Studio
        * Confirmation: Visual Studio's Tools menu has "Run OpenCppCoverage"
    * [ ] Run test coverage
        * Confirmation: See what areas of TrigMath.cpp are green (covered)
    * Confirmation: See 100% coverage of the Asin() method
* [ ] Test TrigMath completely
    * Confirmation: See 100% coverage of the code
    * Code Coverage reached: ______%
* [ ] Explanations and Retrospective

## Homework

* Redo todayâ€™s coding exercises on your own computer
    * See above for the repo location
    * Start from the code on the master branch
    * If you want to see the code we wrote on Day 1, look at the 2020_09_opencourse branch
* Count Number of times you encounter a functional method at work this week
* (Optional) If you write any tests for those methods, please make a note so we can share at the start of next week.
