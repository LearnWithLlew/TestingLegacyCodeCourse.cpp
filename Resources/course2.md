# Course Section 2

## Testing with Approvals
### Basic ApprovalTests

**Scenario:** In this scenario, we are going to redo last week's exercise, introducing Approval Tests, to learn the basics of approvals. 

**In File:** `exercises/exercise1/tests/TrigMathApprovalTests.cpp`

* [ ] Demo: Basic approval of Sin() and Cos()
    * Confirmation:
        * a diff tool opened
        * 2 `.approved.txt` files in source control
        * tests are passing
* [ ] Create a function that tests all 13 methods in TrigMath for one value, 1.0 -    
  `Approvals::verify(runEverything(1.0))`
  * Use `std::stringstream`
  * Hint: for `Atan2` , use 0.4 as the second parameter
  * Confirmation: A large `.approved.txt` file with 13 values
* [ ] Better to-strings, to show function names
    * Confirmation: You can tell which method was called, for each line in `.approved.txt`
* [ ] Test all methods with input value 3.14
    * Confirmation: Another large `.approved.txt` file
### Verify List of Inputs

**Scenario:** In this scenario, we are going to redo the exercise again, to explore more advanced uses of Approval Tests, to handle **large numbers of inputs**. 

* [ ] Make a single test that tests everything for 1.0 and 3.14
    * Hint: read [the docs](https://approvaltestscpp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
    * Confirmation: You should have a call to  `Approvals::verifyAll()`
* [ ] Add values `-0.1, 0, 0.2, 0.8` to your tests for everything
    * Confirmation: Everything except Atan2 should be covered
### Seeing Failures

**Scenario:** In this scenario, we are going to look at how Approval Tests can help us, when tests fail, to identify the differences between **changes that we want**, and **changes we don't.**

* [ ] Improve the precision of `PI`
    * Hint: Use `M_PI`
    * Confirmation: Later digits in the results are different; tests are passing 
* [ ] Turn on `IMPROVEMENT_2`
    * Confirmation: You can tell us what this did; You know if you should fix the tests or undo the change 
* [ ] Better to-strings, to show function names and input values
    * Confirmation: You can tell which method was called, with which value, for each line in `.approved.txt`
    * If using macros: `#define PRINT(x) #x" = " << x`
### Combinations of Inputs

**Scenario:** In this scenario, we are going to redo the exercise again, to explore **incredibly large numbers of inputs**. 

* [ ] Combination approvals - Test `Sin()` for the inputs `{1.0, 3.14, -0.1, 0, 0.2, 0.8}`
    * Confirmation: You should have a `CombinationApprovals::verifyAllCombinations()` call
* [ ] Combination approvals - Test `Atan2` for multiple inputs
    * Confirmation: You have tested `Atan2` with a range of values for both arguments

### Finishing Off
* [ ] Explanations and Retrospective

### Extra Credit:

**Scenario:** In this scenario, we are going to look at a way in C++ to add the methods being tested as one of the parameters. 

* [ ] Test Sin() using a method pointer and standard Catch2 `CHECK`
    * Hints:
    ```
    typedef  int (Fred::*FredMemFn)(char x, float y);
    #define CALL_MEMBER_FN(object,ptrToMember)  ((object).*(ptrToMember))
    int ans = CALL_MEMBER_FN(fred,p)('x', 3.14);
    ```
      * from: https://isocpp.org/wiki/faq/pointers-to-members#typedef-for-ptr-to-memfn
* [ ] Combination approvals - for function pointer inputs
    * Confirmation: You are testing without using `runEverything()`
        * One of your arguments is vector of function pointers

    * Start from the code on the [master branch](https://github.com/LearnWithLlew/TestingLegacyCodeCourse.cpp)
    * If you want to see the code we wrote together, check the [other branches](https://github.com/LearnWithLlew/TestingLegacyCodeCourse.cpp/branches)
* [ ] **Take notes** around printing
    * [ ] **Existing**: What did you find to display data as text?
    * [ ] **Classes**: Which objects would benefit from a printer?
    * [ ] **Ideas**: What would the printer output be like?
